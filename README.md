It is very common to use TodoList in work, study, and life. Most of the applications on the market are still mobile apps, and various functions have been developed to meet the diverse needs of users. There are also some social attributes, some of which cannot avoid the presence of advertisements, and many even require fees I used to create a collaborative Excel spreadsheet for multiple people to record my tasks, but later on, I decided to do it myself and developed a super invincible and minimalist To Do List website! ✨  The UI is all minimalist style (actually too lazy to write), and the entire application only has the most core functions:
✅  Create: Write down whatever comes to mind and never forget anything again!
👀  Read: The refreshing card style layout makes tasks clear at a glance.
🔄  Update: Modify at any time, check the box to complete and feel a great sense of achievement!
🗑️  Delete: Let the completed task go!
In addition, there is also a simple label classification 🏷️， It's super convenient to filter things like # work # study # shopping!
The most important thing is that it is completely free and I developed it myself, and the data is absolutely private and secure! 🔒  Support synchronization between mobile phones and computers, manage your small goals anytime, anywhere!
If you are tired of complexity and only want to return to simplicity and regain focus, then you must give it a try!


在工作学习生活中使用TodoList是非常常见的，市面上的应用其实大多还是手机app，也考虑了用户的多样化需求，开发了各种功能，还有一些社交属性，有些还免不了广告的存在，甚至很多还要收费......我之前一般会创建一个多人协作的excel表格用来记录自己的任务，后来，我干脆自己动手，开发了一个超级无敌简约的To-Do List网站！✨ UI都是极简风格（其实是懒得写了），整个应用只有最核心的功能：
✅ 创建 (Create): 想到什么就记下来，再也不会忘事啦！
👀 查看 (Read): 清爽的卡片式布局，任务一目了然。
🔄 更新 (Update): 随时修改，打勾完成超有成就感！
🗑️ 删除 (Delete): 完成的任务就让它过去吧！
除此之外，还有简单的【标签分类】🏷️，像 #工作 #学习 #购物 这样，筛选起来超方便！
最重要的是，它完全免费，而且是我自己开发的，数据绝对私密安全！🔒 支持手机和电脑同步，随时随地管理你的小目标！
如果你也厌倦了复杂，只想回归简单，找回专注力，那一定要试试它！
